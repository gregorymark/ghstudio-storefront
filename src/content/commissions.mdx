> A commission can be anything you want it to be: portraiture, a landscape, an object.

I can work in a variety of media such as acrylic, oil or pastel and on a variety of materials such as canvas, wood or paper. In terms of subject I can work from photographs or from life.

Works are priced based on media, material and size. I'm happy to discuss commissions to meet personal budgets. Get in touch by [clicking here](mailto:gregorymarkhannan@gmail.com) to email me and we can organise a chat.
