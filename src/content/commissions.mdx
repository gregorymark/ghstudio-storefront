> A commission might be *portraiture*, a *landscape*, a *still life*.

Really anything you can imagine. I can work in a variety of media such as acrylic, oil or pastel and on a variety of materials such as canvas, wood or paper. In terms of subject I can work from photographs or from life.

Works are priced based on media, material and size. I'm happy to discuss commissions to meet personal budgets. Get in touch by [clicking here](mailto:greg@greghannan.studio) to email me and we can organise a chat.
