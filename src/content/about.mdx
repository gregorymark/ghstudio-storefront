> I'm an artist, primarily a painter, with a strong draw towards portraiture and the human figure.

I paint, but also draw, write and whatever else I can find to see what I can learn from those processes. I'm interested in simple aesthetic ideas while probing topics such as male intimacy, highlighting the things we unconsciously project and much more.

I grew up in England on the Kentish coast in Folkestone and lived most of my life in London, where I studied Illustration at Camberwell. I'm now based in Portugal where the coast sometimes reminds me of home.
