# FAQs

## Delivery

Currently we only deliver to the EEU and UK through the site. Do get in touch if you live outside those areas, though, maybe we can work something out :)

## Refunds

In case a product arrived in a damaged or unsatisfactory state, please contact us at greg&#64;greghannan.studio with a description and photographic evidence of the issue. If the issue has arisen from our error we'll happily provide a refund.

If so, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.

Our refund policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can&rsquo;t offer you a refund.

If you haven't received your refund after 10 days of confirmation and you've double checked the correct bank account and have contacted the bank, please contact us at greg&#64;greghannan.studio.
